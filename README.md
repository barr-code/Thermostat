#Thermostat: Week 6 Project at Makers Academy
This thermostat allows you to set the temperature with a press of a button. It also uses the myweather2 API to show 
the current temperature outside, so you can decide how high or low to set your thermostat. It changes color as the temperature gets hotter and colder. Page updates dynamically. Wrapped the whole thing up into a Sinatra app instead of using Ajax requests to access the API.

## Languages and Tools
```
  - JavaScript
  - JQuery
  - HTML
  - CSS
  - Jasmine
  - MyWeather2 API
  - Sinatra
```

###Â How to Open
Clone this repository.
```
  $ git clone git@github.com:barr-code/Thermostat.git
```
Change into the directory.
```
  $ cd thermostat
```
Run my tests.
```
  $ open SpecRunner.html
```

### Fire it Up
```
  $ ruby thermostat.rb
```

### Notes
It was really interesting and cool to make JavaScript and Ruby play nice by running my Thermostat JS back end in a Ruby/Sinatra shell.
